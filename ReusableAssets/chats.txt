Proposed Solution:

Automation: By automating the instrument linkage process, we can save up to 5 hours per day, reduce errors, and ensure scalability as our instrument inventory grows.
Business Benefits:

Efficiency: Significant reduction in manual effort, freeing up resources for higher-value tasks.
Accuracy: Lower risk of errors, leading to more reliable operations.
Scalability: A sustainable process that can easily handle future growth.
Consequences of Not Implementing:

Increased Operational Load: The manual burden will continue to grow, consuming more time and resources.
Higher Error Rates: The likelihood of errors will increase, leading to potential business disruptions.
Inability to Scale: The current process will eventually become unmanageable, leading to operational bottlenecks and reduced competitiveness.
