Title:

SmartSDLC: Prompt-Driven, AI-Powered Platform for End-to-End Software Development Lifecycle Automation


---

Abstract:

SmartSDLC is an AI-first, prompt-engineered platform designed to unify and automate the entire software development lifecycleâ€”from abstract requirement gathering to deploymentâ€”through an intelligent, role-aware workspace. It empowers cross-functional teams to collaborate seamlessly while increasing delivery velocity, traceability, and engineering excellence.


---

Key Capabilities:

1. Business Requirements via Conversational Prompts

Business users can initiate requirement definition using natural language. The system guides them through structured prompts to capture functional and non-functional requirements, transforming abstract ideas into actionable specifications.

2. UI/UX Designer Integration

Designers receive the detailed specs and use built-in tools or integrated Figma support to produce annotated wireframes. SmartSDLC recommends design templates, reusable components, and accessibility enhancements.

3. Architecture Generator with Tooling Support

Architects leverage AI-powered suggestions to produce end-to-end system architectures. The platform supports visual modeling (Mermaid, PlantUML) and generates architecture documents aligned with organizational standards.

4. Development Planning & JIRA Automation

Automatically generates Epics, Stories, and Tasks and syncs directly with JIRA. Progress can be updated via SmartSDLC itself, eliminating context-switching. Sprint summaries, burndown charts, and blockers are tracked in real-time.

5. Agile Iteration & Change Management

SmartSDLC tracks evolving requirements across sprints, dynamically updating specifications, architecture, and backlogs. Versioning and audit trails ensure traceable and compliant delivery.

6. AI-Powered Conversational Agent for UAT & Testing

During test and UAT phases, a built-in conversational agent engages users to:

Log issues conversationally

Aggregate and categorize feedback

Auto-generate tickets in the issue tracker

Track resolution status and user sign-offs
It seamlessly integrates with JIRA to monitor sprint closure readiness and compliance to acceptance criteria.


7. Intelligent Deployment Orchestration

Integrated with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), the platform enables deployment pipeline management, artifact tracking, and release note generation, with rollback capabilities.


---

Innovation Highlights:

Prompt-driven automation for all SDLC phases

AI agent for real-time feedback during testing

Cross-role collaboration in a unified tool

Auto-versioned specifications & architecture

Full JIRA integration without direct JIRA login

Integrated sprint summaries and agile KPIs

Ready for extension with model fine-tuning and enterprise plugins



---

Strategic Value:

Engineering Excellence: Reduces cycle time and manual errors

Technology Modernization: Replaces fragmented tooling with a unified, intelligent platform

AI/ML at Speed and Scale: Democratizes intelligent automation across roles

Resiliency: Enhances delivery predictability, feedback loops, and governance

Would you like me to create a visual workflow diagram or an executive summary PDF/slide version for this abstract submission? That can strengthen the pitch significantly.




Great question. While no single tool currently offers all the capabilities of SmartSDLC in an integrated, prompt-driven, role-aware way, several enterprise-grade platforms cover parts of this vision. Here's a breakdown of existing tools and how they map:


---

Closest Enterprise-Grade Tools (Partial Overlaps)

Tool	What it Covers	Gaps

Atlassian Jira + Confluence + Compass + Atlas	Requirements, backlog, planning, sprint tracking, knowledge base, dependency mapping	No prompt-driven UI, no AI-based architecture generation, no conversational UAT agent
GitHub Copilot + Copilot Workspace (preview)	Code generation, testing suggestions, future planning with AI	Limited to development phase, lacks business-user or designer integration
Microsoft Azure DevOps + Copilot	Planning, repo, build, test, release pipelines + Copilot prompts	Still fragmented; lacks smart UI/architecture generation, conversational test handling
Salesforce Einstein for DevOps	Test feedback, deployment automation with AI insights	Focuses mostly on Salesforce ecosystem
Linear + Notion AI + Figma AI	Lightweight product lifecycle management with some AI support	Designed for startups; not enterprise-hardened or deeply integrated
IBM Watson AIOps + Rational Toolchain	Incident prediction, architecture modeling, requirements management	Traditional AI/ML focus, not modern GenAI or conversational flow-based
GitLab Duo	AI for planning, code suggestions, CI/CD	Focused on dev & ops, no business/user-facing interface or collaborative design input



---

What's Missing in All of Them (Where SmartSDLC Leads):

1. One unified tool that spans business â†’ UI â†’ architecture â†’ development â†’ test â†’ deploy â†’ feedback


2. Prompt-first experience that dynamically adapts to the user role


3. Conversational agents to collect and summarize test feedback + auto-create issues


4. Real-time architecture and design generation based on evolving specs


5. Two-way Jira sync with no need to login


6. Integrated dashboards with AI-generated sprint summaries, status


7. Built-in change tracking + auto-adjustments in architecture/design/code backlog




---

Conclusion:

SmartSDLC is a first-of-its-kind opportunity to:

Combine all these fragmented tools and roles into one seamless platform

Build a truly intelligent SDLC assistant

Align perfectly with enterprise priorities like resilience, velocity, compliance, and AI modernization

If you want, I can also suggest an internal pilot plan: how to prototype SmartSDLC using open-source LLMs + JIRA API + Mermaid.js + LangChain with a frontend built in React/Streamlit. Let me know.




Rationale for Choosing a Project Outside JPMC Premises

To accelerate innovation and streamline development, I opted to build the project outside the JPMC environment. This approach offered the following key advantages:

UI Development: Leveraged tools like Cursor for rapid UI component creation, supported by a rich plugin ecosystem.

ML Model Access: Utilized readily available TensorFlow models from open-source repositories, which would typically require time-consuming approvals within JPMC.

Data Access: Integrated public financial APIs directly, avoiding delays from internal data access protocols and governance layers.

Faster Deployment Cycles: Enabled rapid prototyping and deployment on AWS, bypassing the overhead of coordinating with Atlas 1.0 teamsâ€”achieving changes in seconds rather than days.
