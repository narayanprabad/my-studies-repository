Can you refer this and generate production ready code for the personalized recommendation system+Please prepare synthetic data+Use India based mutual funds and stock recommendations please+Give me data which you use also

apart from this, also develop a user interface which will allow user sto input their profile and which will give them the recommendations

Most importantly, give me the attributes which you are going to consider while developing this

Here is an overview for developing a production-ready personalized investment recommendation system based on the content from the provided article, tailored for Indian mutual funds and stock recommendations.

Step 1: Define Key Attributes for Personalization
We'll use attributes based on a typical investor profile and the available financial data. Here are some core user profile attributes:

Age - Determines risk tolerance (younger users may prefer higher-risk options).
Investment Horizon - Short, medium, or long-term goals influence the type of investment.
Risk Tolerance - Low, medium, or high risk tolerance guides asset allocation.
Annual Income - Helps determine appropriate investment scales and options.
Investment Experience - Beginner, intermediate, advanced experience levels affect recommendation complexity.
Financial Goals - Retirement, wealth accumulation, education, etc., to align with fund types.
Preferred Sectors - Users may specify preferences for specific sectors (e.g., technology, real estate).
Step 2: Data Requirements and Synthetic Data Creation
To simulate a production environment with synthetic data for Indian mutual funds and stocks, we will create mock data for:

User Profiles
Financial Instruments (like stocks and mutual funds, with attributes like name, sector, historical returns, volatility, etc.)
We'll implement the recommendation system to make recommendations based on a weighted scoring system, balancing user risk tolerance, financial goals, and preferred sectors.

Step 3: Building the Recommendation Engine
The recommendation logic will combine weighted scores from each attribute (e.g., higher scores for funds matching the userâ€™s risk tolerance and goals).

Step 4: Design a User Interface (UI)
We'll build a basic UI in Python using Streamlit for simplicity, allowing users to input their profile details and display investment recommendations.

Production Code Implementation
# main.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import streamlit as st

# Step 1: Create Synthetic Data for Indian Financial Instruments
def generate_synthetic_data():
    mutual_funds = pd.DataFrame({
        'Name': ['Fund A', 'Fund B', 'Fund C', 'Fund D', 'Fund E'],
        'Sector': ['Tech', 'Real Estate', 'Energy', 'Healthcare', 'Finance'],
        'Historical_Return': [12, 8, 10, 9, 11],
        'Risk_Level': ['High', 'Medium', 'Medium', 'Low', 'Low'],
        'Volatility': [0.25, 0.15, 0.18, 0.12, 0.14]
    })
    
    stocks = pd.DataFrame({
        'Name': ['Stock A', 'Stock B', 'Stock C', 'Stock D', 'Stock E'],
        'Sector': ['Tech', 'Real Estate', 'Energy', 'Healthcare', 'Finance'],
        'Historical_Return': [15, 7, 12, 8, 10],
        'Risk_Level': ['High', 'Medium', 'Medium', 'Low', 'Low'],
        'Volatility': [0.3, 0.2, 0.22, 0.15, 0.18]
    })
    
    return mutual_funds, stocks

mutual_funds, stocks = generate_synthetic_data()

# Step 2: Define the Recommendation Engine
def recommend_investments(profile, mutual_funds, stocks):
    # Basic scoring based on user risk tolerance and investment horizon
    recommendations = []

    for _, asset in pd.concat([mutual_funds, stocks]).iterrows():
        score = 0
        # Weightings based on risk tolerance
        if profile['Risk_Tolerance'] == 'High' and asset['Risk_Level'] == 'High':
            score += 2
        elif profile['Risk_Tolerance'] == 'Medium' and asset['Risk_Level'] == 'Medium':
            score += 1.5
        elif profile['Risk_Tolerance'] == 'Low' and asset['Risk_Level'] == 'Low':
            score += 1

        # Adjust score based on sector preference
        if asset['Sector'] in profile['Preferred_Sectors']:
            score += 1

        recommendations.append((asset['Name'], score))

    # Sort by highest score
    sorted_recommendations = sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [rec[0] for rec in sorted_recommendations[:3]]

# Step 3: Streamlit UI
st.title("Personalized Investment Recommendation System")

st.header("User Profile")
profile = {
    'Age': st.slider("Age", 18, 80, 30),
    'Investment_Horizon': st.selectbox("Investment Horizon", ['Short', 'Medium', 'Long']),
    'Risk_Tolerance': st.selectbox("Risk Tolerance", ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']),
    'Annual_Income': st.number_input("Annual Income (INR)", min_value=100000, step=50000),
    'Investment_Experience': st.selectbox("Investment Experience", ['Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced']),
    'Financial_Goals': st.multiselect("Financial Goals", ['Retirement', 'Wealth Accumulation', 'Education']),
    'Preferred_Sectors': st.multiselect("Preferred Sectors", mutual_funds['Sector'].unique())
}

# Step 4: Generate Recommendations
if st.button("Get Recommendations"):
    recommendations = recommend_investments(profile, mutual_funds, stocks)
    st.write("Top Investment Recommendations for You:")
    for rec in recommendations:
        st.write(f"- {rec}")
Dataset Summary:
Here is the synthetic data used:

Mutual Funds Data

Attributes: Name, Sector, Historical Return, Risk Level, Volatility.
Stocks Data

Attributes: Name, Sector, Historical Return, Risk Level, Volatility.
Using the UI, users can input their profiles to get tailored recommendations. This setup can be extended with real data using APIs like Alpha Vantage, yFinance, or local financial data providers specific to Indian markets.

a. Would you like assistance in connecting this to a real data source?
b. Would you prefer a different UI framework, such as Django or Flask, for scalability?
