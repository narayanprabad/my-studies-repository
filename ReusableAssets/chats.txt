---

🔧 How to Simulate This in Replit

🔹 Use UI Tabs or Dropdown per Role

Create a dropdown or login switch in UI for:

BA, PO, Architect, UI/UX, Scrum Master, Developer, DevOps, Prod


🔹 Use Cards or Table for Use Cases

Each use case row should show:

Title, Description, Tags, Assigned Role, Action Buttons (View, Approve, Upload, etc.)


🔹 Use Tag-Based Filtering

Based on logged-in role, filter relevant use cases by tags.


🔹 Trigger Actions via Button

E.g., “Approve”, “Upload Design”, “Create Sprint”, “Mark Dev Done” → update status/tag.


---

🧪 Bonus (Optional if time permits)

Use localStorage or JSON file to persist actions.

Simple notifications or status history below each use case.



---

🎯 Summary for Hackathon Demo

Open as BA → create and upload use case.

Switch to PO → approve and tag with #NeedUI, #NeedArchitecture.

Switch to Architect & Designer → upload and mark as ready.

Scrum Master → create sprint.

Developer → mark as done.

DevOps → deploy and push to prod.


That’s your SDLC loop in 5–6 mins 🎯

Project Title: Silent Saver: AI-Powered Detection and Prevention of Hidden Cost Leakages

"JDK 17 enforces stricter TLS 1.3 rules—client certs must include the digitalSignature usage, and weaker ciphers or SHA-1 signatures may be rejected. Please ensure cert compliance and test with -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake to identify handshake failures."

Project Description:
Silent Saver is a cross-LOB, AI-driven platform that continuously monitors applications, infrastructure, and operations to uncover silent but critical cost leakages across J.P. Morgan Chase. Leveraging telemetry data, process flows, control logs, and configuration repositories, Silent Saver applies machine learning, rule mining, and GenAI summarization to proactively identify inefficiencies and misconfigurations that lead to unnecessary financial drain. It then provides actionable recommendations to technology and business stakeholders to fix, reconfigure, or eliminate those drains.

Project Benefits:

Detects and prevents millions of dollars in annual losses

Creates a shared dashboard of savings opportunities across CCB, AWM, and CIB

Helps manage infrastructure and operations spend without impacting headcount

Turns observability into actionable financial insight

Strengthens collaboration between Ops, Tech, and Business teams

Required Skillset:

Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS (CloudWatch, Lambda, S3)

Python (for ML pipeline), SQL, Snowflake

Dynatrace, Splunk, OpenTelemetry

LangChain, GPT-4, Bedrock for GenAI summarization

Cost allocation tagging, FinOps knowledge preferred

Abstract Details - Section 1:
Modern enterprise systems at JPMC generate massive amounts of operational and telemetry data, but most of it remains underutilized when it comes to financial impact analysis. Silent Saver bridges this gap by acting as a continuously running "Cost Intelligence Engine". It connects to systems such as AWS CloudWatch, Snowflake usage logs, Kafka pipelines, Dynatrace, and control flow trackers to identify inefficiencies. Using machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest, clustering, and time-series pattern detection, it finds anomalies in cost behavior. The GenAI layer summarizes these findings into human-readable narratives and links them to tangible financial loss projections. For example, a recurring batch job consuming high compute every Monday that produces no net change in system state is flagged, narrated, and quantified.

Abstract Details - Section 2:
Silent Saver’s detection logic is reinforced through four core engines:

Anomaly Detection Engine: Continuously scans telemetry data for abnormal spikes, drifts, or cyclical inefficiencies.

Rule Learning Module: Learns process rules based on historical successful operations and flags deviations or over-engineering.

Root Cause Mapper: Correlates log patterns and control paths to pinpoint why an inefficiency occurs, not just where.

Recommendation Layer: Uses LLMs to synthesize recommendations like schedule realignment, control simplification, retry suppression, or query optimization.

The platform provides both technical and non-technical dashboards, where developers can deep-dive into metrics while business stakeholders can see dollars lost per day/week/month. Key pilot implementations include:

CIB: Elimination of 30,000/month redundant T+0 job reruns

AWM: Optimization of client call logic to skip non-actionable portfolios

CCB: Reduction of failed ACH retry loops due to outdated routing rules

Individual Value - Call to Action:
Everyone at JPMC can benefit: SREs, Dev teams, Product owners, Ops leads. Plug in your system into Silent Saver. Within days, identify where your system is bleeding dollars — and act before Finance asks questions. Be a proactive cost guardian. Contact the team on #silent-saver-devup for onboarding today.

Would you like me to create a visual workflow diagram or an executive summary PDF/slide version for this abstract submission? That can strengthen the pitch significantly.




Great question. While no single tool currently offers all the capabilities of SmartSDLC in an integrated, prompt-driven, role-aware way, several enterprise-grade platforms cover parts of this vision. Here's a breakdown of existing tools and how they map:


---

Closest Enterprise-Grade Tools (Partial Overlaps)

Tool	What it Covers	Gaps

Atlassian Jira + Confluence + Compass + Atlas	Requirements, backlog, planning, sprint tracking, knowledge base, dependency mapping	No prompt-driven UI, no AI-based architecture generation, no conversational UAT agent
GitHub Copilot + Copilot Workspace (preview)	Code generation, testing suggestions, future planning with AI	Limited to development phase, lacks business-user or designer integration
Microsoft Azure DevOps + Copilot	Planning, repo, build, test, release pipelines + Copilot prompts	Still fragmented; lacks smart UI/architecture generation, conversational test handling
Salesforce Einstein for DevOps	Test feedback, deployment automation with AI insights	Focuses mostly on Salesforce ecosystem
Linear + Notion AI + Figma AI	Lightweight product lifecycle management with some AI support	Designed for startups; not enterprise-hardened or deeply integrated
IBM Watson AIOps + Rational Toolchain	Incident prediction, architecture modeling, requirements management	Traditional AI/ML focus, not modern GenAI or conversational flow-based
GitLab Duo	AI for planning, code suggestions, CI/CD	Focused on dev & ops, no business/user-facing interface or collaborative design input



---

What's Missing in All of Them (Where SmartSDLC Leads):

1. One unified tool that spans business → UI → architecture → development → test → deploy → feedback


2. Prompt-first experience that dynamically adapts to the user role


3. Conversational agents to collect and summarize test feedback + auto-create issues

5. Two-way Jira sync with no need to login


6. Integrated dashboards with AI-generated sprint summaries, status


7. Built-in change tracking + auto-adjustments in architecture/design/code backlog




---

Conclusion:

SmartSDLC is a first-of-its-kind opportunity to:

Combine all these fragmented tools and roles into one seamless platform

Build a truly intelligent SDLC assistant

Align perfectly with enterprise priorities like resilience, velocity, compliance, and AI modernization



---

If you want, I can also suggest an internal pilot plan: how to prototype SmartSDLC using open-source LLMs + JIRA API + Mermaid.js + LangChain with a frontend built in React/Streamlit. Let me know.




Rationale for Choosing a Project Outside JPMC Premises

To accelerate innovation and streamline development, I opted to build the project outside the JPMC environment. This approach offered the following key advantages:

UI Development: Leveraged tools like Cursor for rapid UI component creation, supported by a rich plugin ecosystem.

ML Model Access: Utilized readily available TensorFlow models from open-source repositories, which would typically require time-consuming approvals within JPMC.

Data Access: Integrated public financial APIs directly, avoiding delays from internal data access protocols and governance layers.

Faster Deployment Cycles: Enabled rapid prototyping and deployment on AWS, bypassing the overhead of coordinating with Atlas 1.0 teams—achieving changes in seconds rather than days.
