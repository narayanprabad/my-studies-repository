Project Name: Encore – Redefining Financial Operations with Visionary Innovation

In the intricate world of financial operations, where every second counts and precision is non-negotiable, the Encore application has emerged as a beacon of transformative innovation. Born from the reimagining of the 25-year-old Union2 system—a monolithic application with over 7,500 stored procedures—Encore is not merely a migration; it is a bold leap into the future. It represents a paradigm shift in how financial institutions balance P&L, positions, and trades, while identifying and resolving discrepancies with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and intelligence.

The Challenge: A Legacy System at Its Limits
The Union2 application, once a cornerstone of financial operations, had become a relic of the past. Its rigid architecture, coupled with manual and repetitive processes, created significant bottlenecks. Teams spent countless hours reconciling trades, identifying P&L breaks, and coordinating with middle office and clearing teams. Tasks like product and account linkage consumed up to 4 hours daily, while redundant user touchpoints and lack of automation led to delays, errors, and frustration. The need for a scalable, future-ready solution was not just urgent—it was existential.

The Vision: Encore – A Revolution, Not an Evolution
The Encore team embarked on a mission to not just modernize but revolutionize financial operations. They envisioned a system that would not only address the inefficiencies of the past but also anticipate the needs of the future. By leveraging AWS-native technologies, the team delivered a fully scalable, self-reliant, and intelligent platform that has redefined the boundaries of what is possible.

Encore is not just an application; it is a strategic enabler that empowers organizations to operate with agility, precision, and foresight. Here’s how Encore has set a new standard for innovation:

Architectural Renaissance:
Encore is built on a completely AWS-native architecture, ensuring scalability, resilience, and performance. This foundational shift has future-proofed the application, enabling it to handle exponential data growth and evolving business needs without compromise.

Intelligent Task Tracking – A Game-Changer:
Encore introduces a groundbreaking intelligent task tracking system that allows supervisors to monitor tasks in real-time, assign priorities, and follow up seamlessly. This feature has not only enhanced accountability but also saved hundreds of hours in manual follow-ups, enabling teams to focus on strategic initiatives.

Seamless Collaboration – Breaking Silos:
With integrated Teams and Zoom call initiation, Encore has redefined collaboration. Users can now resolve issues without leaving the application, fostering faster decision-making and breaking down communication silos. This seamless integration has transformed how teams interact, making collaboration effortless and efficient.

Automated Plug Creation and Reporting – Eliminating Redundancy:
Encore’s AI-driven automation identifies and creates plugs between P&L and trades, eliminating manual intervention. It also reports discrepancies directly to the middle office and GMI, streamlining workflows and reducing redundant touchpoints. This innovation has not only accelerated processes but also minimized errors, ensuring data integrity at every step.

Operational Efficiency – Unlocking Potential:
By automating processes like product and account linkage, Encore has reduced operational efforts by 1,000 hours annually. What once took 4 hours now happens in minutes, freeing up valuable resources to focus on higher-value tasks. This efficiency gain is not just a metric; it is a testament to Encore’s transformative impact.

Proactive Issue Resolution – Anticipating Challenges:
Encore doesn’t just identify P&L breaks; it proactively highlights the trades causing the issues, enabling users to report and resolve them swiftly. Once corrected, the system matches them off, completing the cycle with minimal manual intervention. This proactive approach has not only reduced resolution times but also enhanced the overall reliability of financial operations.

The Impact: A New Era of Financial Operations
Encore has delivered impact that transcends numbers. It has fundamentally changed how financial operations are conducted, creating a ripple effect across the organization. The benefits include:

1,000+ hours saved annually in operational efforts, translating to significant cost savings and resource optimization.

Faster reconciliation cycles, reducing time-to-market for critical financial data and enabling quicker decision-making.

Enhanced user experience with intuitive features and seamless integrations, driving adoption and satisfaction.

Scalability and future-readiness, ensuring the application can evolve with the organization’s needs and technological advancements.

Why Encore Deserves the Innovation Award
Encore is not just a tool; it is a vision realized. It represents the culmination of bold thinking, relentless execution, and a commitment to excellence. By reimagining a legacy system and infusing it with cutting-edge technology, the team has set a new benchmark for innovation in financial operations.

Encore’s AWS-native architecture, intelligent automation, and user-centric design have not only solved existing challenges but also unlocked new possibilities for the future. It is a testament to what can be achieved when innovation is driven by purpose and executed with precision.

This project exemplifies the spirit of the Impact Awards—transforming the old into something extraordinary, delivering measurable impact, and paving the way for a smarter, more efficient future. Encore is not just a nominee; it is a visionary force that has redefined the art of the possible.
