I am ecstatic to bring to your notice that the Bangalore team hosted a fantastic Q3 event, which left everyone with big smiles and a sense of positive energy. The theme of the event was relationships, focusing on friends and family, which reminded us of the joy and support these connections bring into our lives. Here are some glimpses of the event that captured these beautiful moments. My sincere thanks to our key presenters—Rinki Maheshwari, Gautham Sundara Murthy, and Yashika Garg—for their touching presentation. Joel nailed it with an exciting team game, and Sunanda Raikar made the birthday segment memorable. And most importantly, a special thanks to our energetic host, Somya Prasad, who coordinated it all beautifully.

We also want to acknowledge Ruchi, who was supposed to be our chief guest but couldn't attend due to being stuck in meetings. We appreciate her support nonetheless. Additionally, our apologies to Sumit, whom we missed inviting as we were unaware he was around.

A big thank you to the entire Bangalore team for their active participation and for sharing their life experiences, which added so much depth to the event.
