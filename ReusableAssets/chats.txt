I would like to take this opportunity to provide clarity regarding the delays in the Union2 migration project and outline the steps being taken to mitigate these challenges.Union2 is a highly complex system with over 9,000 procedures, which has significantly contributed to the technical challenges encountered during the migration process. The architecture of the system involves intricate integrations and interdependencies with critical risk platforms such as Pramod and Pandora, requiring additional time for comprehensive testing and customization.The key reasons for the delays include:System Complexity: The scope of Union2, with its extensive procedural components and interlinked subsystems, has required additional time for testing to ensure stability and accuracy. Managing the high volume of dependencies has been more challenging than anticipated during the initial planning stages.Handling Complex Customizations: Systems like Pramod and Pandora involve substantial customizations that were only fully realized during the migration phase. The custom logic for these systems, combined with their critical nature in day-to-day operations, has required detailed planning and execution to avoid disruptions.Resource Constraints: Our team has faced unforeseen resource challenges due to ongoing parallel initiatives. While we have made efforts to allocate resources appropriately, certain critical tasks were delayed as we balanced the competing demands of multiple ongoing projects.Despite these challenges, the team is fully committed to ensuring the project is completed on time. Additional efforts are being made to meet the critical December production parallel run and JAM migration milestones. The team continues to work extended hours to ensure all necessary testing, customizations, and validations are completed to deliver a successful migration.We understand the importance of this migration and are taking all necessary measures to bring it back on track while maintaining the highest standards of quality. We will continue to keep you updated on our progress and any further developments.Thank you for your understanding and continued support.Best regards,
