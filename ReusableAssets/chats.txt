9Absolutely — "Autonomous Reconciliation Designer" is a fantastic, cutting-edge idea — especially relevant in financial services, compliance, or operations automation. It fits beautifully under AI/ML Delivery, Engineering, or Customer/Employee Experience tracks. Let’s break it down:

💡 Topic Idea:
“Autonomous Reconciliation Designer: AI-Powered Reconciliation Without Manual Rules”
🔍 What Is It?
An Autonomous Reconciliation Designer is a no-code or low-code AI-driven system that allows users to:

Define reconciliation goals or rules in natural language

Automatically map data sources, detect breaks, and suggest match rules

Use machine learning to identify patterns, noise, or exceptions


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_workdays(start_date_str TEXT, end_date_str TEXT)
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
  start_date DATE;
  end_date DATE;
  workdays INTEGER;
BEGIN
  -- Convert input strings to dates
  start_date := TO_DATE(start_date_str, 'YYYYMMDD');
  end_date := TO_DATE(end_date_str, 'YYYYMMDD');

  -- If dates are the same, return 0 immediately
  IF start_date = end_date THEN
    RETURN 0;
  END IF;

  -- Calculate workdays between dates (excluding weekends)
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO workdays
  FROM GENERATE_SERIES(
    LEAST(start_date, end_date) + INTERVAL '1 day', -- Start from day after earlier date
    GREATEST(start_date, end_date),                 -- End at later date
    INTERVAL '1 day'
  ) AS day
  WHERE EXTRACT(DOW FROM day) BETWEEN 1 AND 5; -- Count only Mon (1) to Fri (5)

  RETURN workdays;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

🎯 Real-World Scenario
Instead of writing complex SQL joins or manually setting up reconciliation rules like:

“Match trade amounts between Book A and Book B if currency = USD and date is within T+1”

Users could input:

"Reconcile trade data across internal and external sources. Flag mismatches where counterparty amount doesn't align within 1-day range."

And the system would:

Parse intent with an LLM

Generate a reconciliation logic flow

Learn from historical breaks to auto-categorize as valid or noise

Offer auto-adjustments or pass to human queue

🛠️ Key Capabilities
Natural Language Input

Users describe reconciliation intent in plain English

LLM interprets the context and generates a rule engine or ML workflow

Self-learning Break Classification

Historical data is used to train a model

Identifies valid, invalid, or noise breaks

Learns from feedback and adapts

Auto-Healing & Smart Adjustments

If a break is known and fixable, the system auto-adjusts and logs justification

No-code Rule Designer

Drag-and-drop or voice-command style interface to define reconciliation logic

Auditing & Explainability

Tracks why and how decisions were made

Outputs human-readable justifications for audit or compliance teams

✅ Benefits
💼 Massive Ops Efficiency: 1000+ hours/year saved on manual reconciliations

📈 Improved Accuracy: Fewer human errors, better pattern recognition

🧠 Institutional Memory: Doesn’t forget learned logic even with staff turnover

🔐 Audit-Ready: Full traceability and transparency

🤖 Faster Time-to-Market: No need to write/rewrite reconciliation logic manually

🧰 Required Skills
NLP and LLM Integration (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock)

ML modeling (classification, clustering, pattern detection)

SELECT
  COALESCE(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (
      WHERE EXTRACT(DOW FROM day) BETWEEN 1 AND 5 -- 1=Mon to 5=Fri
    ),
    0
  ) AS workday_diff
FROM
  GENERATE_SERIES(
    LEAST(TO_DATE('20240101', 'YYYYMMDD'), TO_DATE('20240105', 'YYYYMMDD')) + INTERVAL '1 day',
    GREATEST(TO_DATE('20240101', 'YYYYMMDD'), TO_DATE('20240105', 'YYYYMMDD')),
    INTERVAL '1 day'
  ) AS day;

Backend engineering (data pipelines, streaming reconciliation, anomaly detection)

React or low-code UI dev for rule designer

Domain knowledge (finance, trade matching, compliance, etc.)

🔗 Session Formats
Live demo: From natural language → reconciliation logic → auto-classification

Before & after case study (manual vs autonomous recon)

Discuss architecture (LLM + rules engine + feedback loop + audit layer)
