 Project Benefits
Scalability Without Overhead
Serverless architecture automatically scales based on demand, making it ideal for deploying LLMs or AI agents that may experience variable usage patterns.

Cost Efficiency
Pay-per-use models ensure that organizations only pay for compute when the AI models are actually being usedâ€”ideal for startups and enterprises alike.

Faster Time-to-Market
With managed services (e.g., AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Bedrock, Azure Functions), developers can rapidly prototype and deploy AI-powered microservices without managing infrastructure.

Improved Security & Compliance
Cloud-native security (IAM, encryption at rest and in transit, private endpoints) ensures secure deployment of sensitive AI workloads, which is critical in regulated industries.

Modular & Composable Architecture
LLM-based microservices can be independently versioned, deployed, and reused across multiple products, allowing greater flexibility and agility.

Empowering Citizen Developers
With abstracted infrastructure, non-ML engineers or business users can also deploy and consume intelligent services via APIs or lightweight UIs.

Sustainability
Optimized compute usage and zero idle capacity support greener AI adoption, aligning with enterprise sustainability goals.
