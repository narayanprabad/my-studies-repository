Project Name: Encore – Visionary AWS-Native Transformation

Encore revolutionizes financial operations by reimagining the 25-year-old Union2 system (7,500+ stored procedures) into a scalable, AWS-native powerhouse. It automates P&L/position balancing, identifies trade breaks, and resolves discrepancies via AI-driven workflows, eliminating 1,000+ hours of annual manual effort. Features like intelligent task tracking, integrated Teams/Zoom collaboration, and auto-reporting to middle office/GMI streamline operations, slashing 4-hour tasks to minutes. Proactive issue resolution, automated plug creation, and future-proof scalability redefine efficiency. Encore transcends migration—it’s a strategic leap, empowering teams with precision, agility, and innovation. A legacy reborn, it sets a new benchmark in financial technology.
