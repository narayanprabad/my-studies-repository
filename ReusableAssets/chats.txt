I would like to commend Sanchit for his outstanding contributions to the team, especially as a new developer and fresh graduate. Despite being early in his career, he has taken full ownership of the complex Intraday Transaction API, which has been a cornerstone for the success of ENCORE and its intraday reconciliation processes. His deep understanding and ability to handle such complexity at an early stage speak volumes about his technical acumen and dedication.

In addition to his API ownership, Sanchit has become a champion of Terraform within the team. His support and expertise in resolving issues related to Terraform have been invaluable, further enhancing the team's productivity and technical capabilities.

I have consistently observed Sanchit to be positive, enthusiastic, and proactive in his approach. He actively participates in and leads employee engagement activities in Bangalore, demonstrating his well-roundedness beyond technical contributions. Sanchit is truly a great addition to the Global Clearing team, and I have no doubt that he has a bright future ahead of him.
