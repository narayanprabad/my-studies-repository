Project Title: ClientPulse 360° – AI-Powered Client Emotion & Intent Intelligence Layer

Project Description: ClientPulse 360° is a real-time, AI-powered platform that captures, analyzes, and synthesizes emotional, behavioral, and transactional signals across all client touchpoints. From voice calls and tickets to trading behavior and email responses, the system builds an evolving picture of each client's emotional journey. This allows business and operations teams to detect early signs of client frustration, predict churn, identify upsell opportunities, and trigger proactive interventions. Unlike traditional CRM analytics, ClientPulse 360° introduces a new paradigm: making emotional and behavioral insight a first-class data stream at JPMC.

Project Benefits:

Reduces client churn through proactive emotional intelligence

Detects dissatisfaction before escalation, reducing reputational and financial risk

Identifies upsell opportunities in high-sentiment, high-engagement accounts

Enhances RM and service team effectiveness with contextual insights

Boosts NPS/CX without relying solely on surveys


Required Skillset:

Python, FastAPI, Spring Boot (for service orchestration)

LLMs via OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, or Bedrock with fine-tuned intent models

Speech-to-text: AWS Transcribe, Whisper

Sentiment and emotion classification: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT

Time-series anomaly detection using Prophet, FB Kats, or custom RNNs

CRM/CTI integrations (Salesforce, JIRA, ServiceNow)

Vector DBs (FAISS, Pinecone) for fast intent pattern retrieval


Abstract Details - Section 1: In a large financial institution like JPMC, client perception is the heartbeat of long-term value. Unfortunately, current systems only respond after an issue occurs: after a complaint is filed, after a call is escalated, or after a client stops responding. ClientPulse 360° transforms this paradigm by ingesting and interpreting live interaction signals from client communication and behavior.

The system integrates:

Voice and call transcripts via AWS Transcribe and Whisper

Email exchanges and service tickets via Salesforce APIs

Trading and login behavior via Kafka and internal APIs

Tone and urgency changes from customer interactions


These signals are passed through a multi-stage GenAI pipeline:

1. Speech/Text Normalization: Converts spoken or informal language into structured client intent phrases.


2. Emotion Classification Layer: Classifies each interaction across axes: joy, confusion, frustration, trust, urgency.


3. Intent Prediction Layer: Uses RAG-based fine-tuned LLMs to map statements to business intents: churn risk, upsell potential, compliance frustration, etc.


4. Time-Series Tracker: Builds emotional timelines for every client over rolling 90-day windows.


5. Alert Generator: Scores clients using multi-factor emotional + transactional signals, and routes high-risk patterns to RMs with AI-generated summaries.



The model is constantly fine-tuned using Ops feedback, RM annotations, and outcomes data to improve precision.

Abstract Details - Section 2: The platform supports three main user views:

RM View: Shows relationship managers their client base, sorted by emotional health, with reasons for alerts and next best action prompts.

Ops & Service View: Lists trending concerns ("payments not clearing," "slow onboarding") based on client tone clusters.

Product Insights View: Aggregates emotional feedback per feature, release, or product type (e.g., mobile app, margin lending, statement generation).


Security and compliance:

All PII is redacted at preprocessing using named entity recognition

Models operate within JPMC's secured model infrastructure with no external API leakage

Fully auditable predictions with traceable feature contributions for model transparency


Sample AI Summary:

> "Client John Smith displayed elevated frustration and urgency in three calls this week. Topic cluster: Margin calls and app performance. Suggested action: Schedule senior RM callback within 48 hours."



Individual Value - Call to Action: If you're a relationship manager, ops lead, or service director – ClientPulse 360° is your emotional radar. Join the pilot by tagging your LOB in #clientpulse-devup and we will plug in your client data streams for insights within 1 week. Don't wait for escalations. Feel your clients before they leave.

Great — I've added improvement comments to the Silent Saver DevUp extract so it's aligned in depth and impact with ClientPulse 360°.

Would you like me to:

Expand Silent Saver with richer technical details now (as per the comments)?

Then generate polished PDF documents for both?


Let me know, and I’ll proceed with the final production.
