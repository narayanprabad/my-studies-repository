1. Data Sources: Multiple feeds from various sources
2. Trigger: AWS Lambda function triggers the processing workflow
3. Workflow Orchestration: AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the workflow and track data availability
4. Data Enrichment (Complex Rules, Huge Data):
   - EMR Job: Use Elastic MapReduce (EMR) to process large datasets with complex enrichment rules
   - EMR Cluster: Configure an EMR cluster with appropriate instances and resources
   - EMR Job Config: Define the enrichment rules as EMR jobs and pass necessary parameters
   - Data Storage: Store the processed data in an appropriate data storage service (e.g., Amazon S3)
5. Data Enrichment (Complex Rules, Small Data):
   - ECS Task: Use Elastic Container Service (ECS) to run containers for processing smaller datasets
   - ECS Cluster: Configure an ECS cluster and task definitions
   - ECS Task Launch: Initiate the ECS task to process the data and apply the enrichment rules
   - Data Storage: Store the processed data in an appropriate data storage service (e.g., Amazon S3)
6. Data Enrichment (Easy Rules, Small or Huge Data):
   - ECS or EMR: Choose between ECS tasks or EMR jobs based on the data size and complexity of rules
   - ECS Task or EMR Job Launch: Initiate the appropriate task or job for data enrichment
   - Data Storage: Store the processed data in an appropriate data storage service (e.g., Amazon S3)
7. Expression Language for Transformation: AWS Glue for converting raw feeds to enriched format using expression languages like Apache Spark SQL
8. Reconciliation: Perform the reconciliation process using the enriched data and configurable parameters
9. Result Storage: Store the final reconciled data in a suitable data storage service (e.g., Amazon S3)

Note: The architecture described above is a high-level representation and may require additional components and configurations based on specific requirements and AWS service choices.
