Steps for Including Twitter Trends in your application

(i) Get the Twitter API Keys and map it in your application. Refer http://narayanprabad.blogspot.in/ for more details. Store it in Database or Properties file. For the test application I have created, I have stored the information in a properties file.
(ii) Copy the twitter4j-core-3.0.5.jar to your application classpath. Say, WEB-INF/lib folder of your webapps directory.
(iii) You can include twitter_trends_include.jsp in your application. Refer twitter\twitter_trends.jsp. This contains demo code to include Twitter trends. Also code to select Geo Location is also given. You can refer twitter_locations_include.jsp for this purpose.
