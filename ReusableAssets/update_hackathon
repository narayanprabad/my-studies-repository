Subject: Smart SDLC Platform â€“ Innovation Showcase from Hackathon

Dear [Senior Leadership / Team],

Iâ€™d like to briefly share highlights from our recent hackathon submissionâ€”Smart SDLC, a working prototype of an AI-powered software development lifecycle management platform tailored for investment banking.

Though we didnâ€™t make it to the final awards (the competition was intense), the feedback from judges was highly positiveâ€”particularly on the platformâ€™s potential to replace fragmented tools like ServiceNow and Jira, delivering long-term cost and efficiency benefits.

ðŸ§  What We Built
A role-based, intelligent SDLC platform that:

Automatically parses natural language into structured functional/non-functional requirements

Supports Business Analyst and Product Owner flows with regulatory-aligned templates

Demonstrates potential to streamline project planning and approval workflows, targeting ~$4M in annual productivity savings

ðŸ’» Tech Stack & Deployment
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js 20

AI Integration:

Generative Layer: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)

Semantic Refinement Layer: TensorFlow.js with custom-trained BERT for financial domain

Deployment:

Fully functional deployment on AWS native sandbox

Live Bedrock integration

Authentication with dynamic role-based interface

Functional flows for Business Analyst and Product Owner roles

ðŸš€ Key Learnings
Efficiently integrated a hybrid AI architecture (cloud + local) for intelligent document parsing

Understood the practical value of role-based workflows in regulated environments

Delivered a robust prototype under 20 hoursâ€”ready to be scaled or piloted for enterprise use

ðŸ“½ Demo & Next Steps
The attached GIF illustrates the end-to-end user journeyâ€”from AI-powered requirement generation to structured grooming workflows. Weâ€™d be glad to walk through the platform live and discuss next steps if there's interest.

Thank you for fostering a culture that encourages experimentation and innovation. This project was a valuable learning experience for our team, and weâ€™re excited about its future potential.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Designation]
[Your Team / Department]
