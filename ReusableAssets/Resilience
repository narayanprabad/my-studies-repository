**Project Title:** ResiliNet – AI-Driven Resilience Graph for Proactive Risk Intelligence and Engineering Foresight

**Project Description:**
ResiliNet is an enterprise-grade, AI-powered resilience graph that provides a real-time, continuously updated map of system dependencies, operational controls, recovery pathways, and failure propagation risks across J.P. Morgan Chase. By combining graph intelligence, telemetry integration, and LLM-based reasoning, ResiliNet transforms incident hindsight into resilience foresight. It empowers engineering, operations, and control functions to proactively identify single points of failure, assess downstream business impact, simulate incident scenarios, and generate actionable design recommendations to fortify system resilience.

**Project Benefits:**

* Enhances firm-wide resilience posture by proactively illuminating architectural and control fragilities
* Reduces incident frequency and mitigates blast radius through early detection of high-risk configurations
* Accelerates RCA efforts by delivering real-time AI-generated root cause narratives
* Strengthens audit readiness with visualized recovery architecture and resilience scoring
* Unifies fragmented resilience efforts across engineering, operations, and compliance into one intelligent system

**Required Skillset:**

* Spring Boot and Python (FastAPI) for integration services
* Neo4j or NetworkX for dynamic graph modeling of system dependencies
* OpenTelemetry, CloudWatch, and Dynatrace for telemetry ingestion
* LangChain with GPT-4 or Claude for RCA reasoning and report generation
* Front-end development using React or Dash for resilience dashboards
* Domain knowledge in failure handling, control design, incident management workflows, and SLA architectures

**Abstract Details – Section 1: (Technical Architecture)**
ResiliNet is built on a modular architecture comprising three core layers:

1. **Resilience Mapping Engine:**

   * Ingests service registries, job dependency metadata, telemetry logs, and control configurations
   * Constructs a live dependency graph across microservices, batch jobs, Kafka topics, and recovery workflows
   * Scores each node with a “Resilience Index” based on failure handling coverage, retry health, SLA criticality, and historical incident impact

2. **Failure Simulation and RCA Module:**

   * Enables teams to simulate potential failure scenarios — such as lag in event streams, storage bottlenecks, or downstream API unavailability
   * Predicts blast radius based on system dependencies, SLA exposure, and control coverage gaps
   * Uses LLMs to generate detailed, human-readable RCA narratives and architectural suggestions

3. **Design Optimization & Recovery Advisor:**

   * Identifies missing fallbacks, duplicated retry paths, alert fatigue points, and blind control spots
   * Recommends design enhancements such as queuing strategies, cache-layer insertion, alert consolidation, or timeout tuning
   * Generates “Resilience Blueprints” for periodic resilience reviews, onboarding documentation, and compliance readiness

**Abstract Details – Section 2: (Business Relevance & Cross-LOB Differentiation)**
ResiliNet provides a common platform for engineering, risk, controls, and business to collaborate around resilience. It breaks organizational silos by offering tailored dashboards:

* **Engineering teams** see the system-level health, dependency tightness, and recovery plan strength
* **Ops teams** view risk alerts, config drift, and downstream SLA impact
* **Control owners** evaluate the coverage and effectiveness of operational controls
* **Business stakeholders** understand the resilience of client-facing systems with business impact quantification

Key examples of impact:

* In Asset & Wealth Management, ResiliNet uncovered redundant control logic across onboarding pipelines, reducing runtime inefficiencies by 40%
* In CIB, it revealed a deep dependency loop across regulatory reporting jobs, helping teams stagger schedules and reduce failure chains
* In Consumer Banking, it identified legacy alerting loops that were overwhelming Tier-1 support, prompting targeted alert optimization

**Individual Value – Call to Action:**
ResiliNet empowers you to assess, design, and communicate the resilience of your systems with clarity and confidence. Whether you're an SRE, a developer, a control manager, or a product lead — ResiliNet helps you foresee fragility, preempt failures, and strengthen your domain against operational stress.

Get started by onboarding your system into ResiliNet’s pilot. Visualize your resilience posture. Simulate real-world failure scenarios. Receive guided, AI-powered recommendations tailored to your architecture.
